# 🔌 Virtual Circuit Simulator – Nodal Analysis in Python

A Python-powered CLI tool that simulates voltage behavior in complex resistor-current sensor networks using **nodal analysis**, a core technique in electrical engineering.

---

## 🌍 Hypothetical Use Case

Inspired by a simulated industrial case: engineers observed voltage drops across an 8-node IoT sensor grid in a smart factory. This tool was built to analyze such behavior **before prototyping hardware**.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Simulates up to 8+ nodes
- Accepts resistor and current-source configurations
- Calculates node voltages using matrix algebra
- Fast CLI output with NumPy

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

Node Voltages in Simulated Sensor Network:
Node1: -3.059 V
Node2: -2.240 V
Node3: -2.344 V
Node4: -2.490 V
Node5: -2.769 V
Node6: -3.191 V
Node7: -3.745 V

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install numpy
python circuit_solver.py

 What I Learned
✅ Electrical theory → real simulation
✅ Used NumPy for real matrix math
✅ Simulated power distribution for smart devices


If you want, I can also:
- Draft a **Git commit history** to show progress
- Make a **diagram** of the 8-node sensor network
- Help design a **GitHub repo banner**
